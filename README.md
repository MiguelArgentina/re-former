## Project Name: Bare Metal Forms and Helpers

### Objective:
Building forms, from nearly-pure HTML to using the helper methods that Rails provides. The Rails way sends parameters to a controller which builds an instance of a model with those parameters for the view.

## Features

> The front end ( `http://localhost:3000/users/new` ) displays a form which allows a user to input their username, email and password.
> The back end shows the server output and/or any errors stack trace.
> None of the input fields can be blank on the edit page: `http://localhost:3000/users/1`.
> On the edit page, if a user tries submitting a form that fails the validations, a list of error messages attached to the failed model is displayed.
